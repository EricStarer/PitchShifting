what to do about silence detection? calculate energy first before even attempting to run the YIN algorithm?
what if the threshold is such that frames which aren't silent are considered so? there was sort of an example of this.
if we use the frequency estimate from the previous frame and the silence is at the end of a sound decaying this is fine 
since the frequency of the frame will very likely be the same. the attack in the at the beginning of a sound should
spike the energy enough that it should happen in the beginning. the pitch mark detection algorithm for a guitar signal
is much less complicated than that for speech signals as the waveform is much less complicated. the main problem now
is what to do with the frames that are considered silence. how do we establish the pitchmark locations, use the same
maximum based method or just use a fixed rate? when windowing the frame and overlapping it with the others how much does
having a "correct" pitch mark placement matter considering we're just dealing with silence here? i suppose that would
depend on how loud the "voiced" segments are in comparison (i.e what are the amplitude ratios?). normalizing would
definitely have an impact here.
