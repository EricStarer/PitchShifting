how to account for gradual pitch mark drift? how much will using "true" pitch period change this?
should we eventually reset and align with a proper pitch mark? if so how do we know when to? could
we measure drift somehow? that's easy if B is set to 1 but if we're actually shifting the signal by
some amount then it would be harder to keep track of. maybe if everytime B goes to 1 it resets the
the synthesis pitch marks to remove the effects of drift. maybe after a certain number of frames are 
processed we automatically reset the pitch marks to be realigned? maybe base it on the amount of shift
being applied? what kind of effect would pitch mark drift have anyways? would it necessarily be bad?
it might result in everything being shifted a bit as long as it's applied in the same way, would that
mitigate the audible effects?
